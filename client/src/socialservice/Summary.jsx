        Social service, as reflected in the Bible, emphasizes caring for others, especially the marginalized, the poor, and the vulnerable. The Bible encourages believers to show compassion, kindness, and generosity, treating acts of service as a reflection of their love for God. Social service is seen as an essential part of Christian life, 
        where believers are called to serve others selflessly, following the example of Jesus Christ.
