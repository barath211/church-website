        Worship is a central practice in the Christian faith, where believers express their reverence, love, and adoration for God. It is both a personal and communal act that acknowledges Godâ€™s greatness, holiness, and sovereignty. Worship can take various forms, including singing,
         prayer, scripture reading, and living a life that honors God.
