            Church Contribution and Biblical Perspective
          </h2>
          <p className="text-lg text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
            Church contribution is a fundamental aspect of Christian stewardship and community involvement. It encompasses various forms of giving, including financial donations, volunteering time and talents, and offering support to those in need. In the Christian faith, contributing to the church is not merely a financial obligation but a spiritual act of worship and obedience to God's teachings. It reflects a commitment to the church's mission and the broader community it serves.

            Biblical teachings emphasize the importance of generosity and cheerful giving. One of the most cited verses on this topic is found in 2 Corinthians 9:7, which states, "Each of you should give what you have decided in your heart to give, not reluctantly or under compulsion, for God loves a cheerful giver." This verse underscores the voluntary nature of giving and encourages believers to give with joy and sincerity, rather than out of obligation.
