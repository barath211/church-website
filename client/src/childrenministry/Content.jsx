      Our Children’s Ministry is dedicated to nurturing young hearts by teaching them about God’s love, kindness, and truth in a joyful and safe environment. We believe that every child is a precious gift from God and has a unique purpose. Through engaging Bible lessons, creative activities, songs, and games, we aim to inspire children to grow in their faith and develop a personal relationship with Jesus Christ. Our goal is to equip children with the knowledge of God’s Word, encourage them to live out their faith boldly, and build a strong foundation for their future. We invite your little ones to join us on this exciting journey of learning, laughter, and spiritual growth!
